##------------ Animal Gifs -------------##

* I kept the theme of animals to show a continuation of branding and style. The user can select an animal listed or create their own animal button by submitting their animal in the form. 

* When an animal button is selected 10 gifs relating to that animal will show on the page. Also, the rating of the gif will show under the gif. If the user selects another animal button, 10 gifs of that animal will be added to the previous gifs.
